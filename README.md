# RPLang
*Rapid Prototype Language*

This project is built around my semi-working qlogic project but implemented in c++. This project aims at parsing and interperating the RPLanguage in a library format, allowing for additions that would implement rapid prototyping. In other words, this project itself is not the part that is for rapid prototyping but it implements the framework for kits that will.
